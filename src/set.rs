/// A hash set where the iteration order of the values is independent of their
/// hash values.
///
/// The interface is closely compatible with the standard `HashSet`, but also
/// has additional features.
///
/// # Order
///
/// The values have a consistent order that is determined by the sequence of
/// insertion and removal calls on the set. The order does not depend on the
/// values or the hash function at all. Note that insertion order and value
/// are not affected if a re-insertion is attempted once an element is
/// already present.
///
/// All iterators traverse the set *in order*.  Set operation iterators like
/// `union` produce a concatenated order, as do their matching "bitwise"
/// operators.  See their documentation for specifics.
///
/// The insertion order is preserved, with **notable exceptions** like the
/// `.remove()` or `.swap_remove()` methods. Methods such as `.sort_by()` of
/// course result in a new order, depending on the sorting order.
///
/// # Indices
///
/// The values are indexed in a compact range without holes in the range
/// `0..self.len()`. For example, the method `.get_full` looks up the index for
/// a value, and the method `.get_index` looks up the value by index.
///
/// # Complexity
///
/// Internally, `IndexSet<T, S>` just holds an [`IndexMap<T, (), S>`](IndexMap). Thus the complexity
/// of the two are the same for most methods.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use indexmap::IndexSet;
///
/// // Collects which letters appear in a sentence.
/// let letters: IndexSet<_> = "a short treatise on fungi".chars().collect();
///
/// assert!(letters.contains(&'s'));
/// assert!(letters.contains(&'t'));
/// assert!(letters.contains(&'u'));
/// assert!(!letters.contains(&'y'));
